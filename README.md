A (currently) customized Database application for the membership of a sailing club

<b>Uses a tree leaf style organization for memberships</b>

The tree of the system is a list of all memberships, which can be sorted as active, inactive, new members, return members, members with slips and many others.

This system is designed to be powerful and intuitive.  It has the ability to quickly create PDF and Excel documents to aid in the job.  For example it can create a PDF of all the slips as they currently are
It can create PDF's for each deposit.  It can even render an entire directory to be used in printing a physical copy for club members.

Memberships, people, slips, deposits etc.
